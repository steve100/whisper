## 🎧 Speeding Up Audio to Save on Transcription Costs

OpenAI charges **per minute of audio**, so if you speed up the audio before uploading, you reduce cost and processing time.

## ⚙️ How to Speed Up Audio with `ffmpeg`

You can use this command-line tool to increase playback speed without changing pitch.

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to expand: ffmpeg commands</strong></summary>

```bash
# Double speed (2×)
ffmpeg -i input.wav -filter:a "atempo=2.0" -vn output_2x.wav

# Triple speed (3×)
ffmpeg -i input.wav -filter:a "atempo=1.5,atempo=2.0" output_3x.wav
```

</details>

## 🎯 When is it Safe to Speed Up?

| Speed | Use Case                    | Accuracy Risk |
|-------|-----------------------------|---------------|
| 1.5×  | Conversational speech       | Low           |
| 2.0×  | Clear narration, interviews | Medium        |
| 3.0×+ | For summaries / gist only   | High          |
